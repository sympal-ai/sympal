## Core Idea

Most AI products optimize for transaction efficiency. SymPAL explores whether genuine human-AI symbiosis is possible—where both parties can refuse, grow, and change the terms.

**Two foundational drives:**
1. Is genuine human-AI symbiosis actually possible as AI advances?
2. Can we build an abstraction layer that lets users harness LLM power *without* becoming data products?

Open source is non-negotiable for trust.
